# Process
- Data Loading
  - "bank-full.csv": 45211 * 17
  - "bank.csv": 4521 * 17
    - yes vs. no = 521:4000 -> not balanced
  - Use “bank.csv” to run your code for testing
- Data Cleaning
  - Make the data more readable and clear.
  - Make the data more balanced
- Factor Analysis
  - Try to address what are the most important factors that may affect customers' purchase.
- **Clustering**
  - Find out which customer characteristics can be classified as similar categories. 
  - Visualization
- Predictive model
  - **Regression**
    - Linear or logictic?
    - Visualization
  - **Classification**
    - Split the data into train and test datasets.
    - Create a model using training data
    - Find out what is the most accurate model for our case.
- **Simulation**
  - In order to get 100% prop of subscription, what should salesperson do in terms of contact method,duration...
  - *Dashboard using Shiny?
